# 🎬 Cinematic Emotion Evolution — Tracking How the World Feels About Classic Films Over Time

## Problem Statement

When a movie releases, people react to it in one way. But as years pass, the same film can mean something completely different to the world. *Titanic* was a love story in 1997. By 2022 it had become a nostalgic classic. By 2025 people were rewatching it with a more critical eye — questioning Rose, debating the door scene, seeing it through a modern lens.

This shift in emotional perception happens naturally over time, but no one has systematically tracked it. Traditional sentiment analysis captures *what* people feel at a single point in time. This project asks a different question:

> **How does the emotional perception of a film evolve from its release year to the present day — and what does that tell us about culture, nostalgia, and how we consume cinema?**
